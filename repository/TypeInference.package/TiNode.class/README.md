My two principal messages are:
	#seed: anAtomicType
	#connectTo: targetTiNode

	#seed: is sent in two cases:
		- when the receiver is seeded for the first time. (see [AGE/96] 3.2.1 Step 2)
		- when some other node to which the receiver is connected, propagates its
 		  AtomicTypes. (see [AGE/96] 3.2.1. Step 3)"
